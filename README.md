# Welcome to My Java Book Repository

I am currently reading *Java: The Complete Reference* (11th edition) by Herbert Schildt. So far, Iâ€™ve covered Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and several foundational topics.

To better reinforce my learning, I am using this repository to practice and implement what I learn from each chapter. Here's an overview of my progress:

## Chapter Progress:
- **Chapter 10: Exception Handling**  
  *Date Started: October 24, 2024*  
  Focus on handling exceptions in Java for robust applications.

- **Chapter 11: Multithreaded Programming**  
  *Date Started: October 24, 2024*  
  Understanding multi-threading and its use cases for concurrent programming.

- **Chapter 12: Enumeration, Autoboxing, and Annotations**  
  *Date Started: October 25, 2024*  
  Exploring Java features like enums, autoboxing, and annotations.

- **Chapter 13: Generics**  
  *Date Started: November 7, 2024*  
  Working with generic types to create flexible and reusable code.

- **Chapter 15: Lambda Expressions**  
  *Date Started: November 8, 2024*  
  Part 1: Learning about functional programming concepts in Java.

## Completed Topics:
- Exception Handling
- Multithreaded Programming
- Generics
- Lambda Expressions

This repository serves as a hands-on guide to cementing the concepts from *Java: The Complete Reference*. Each chapter contains examples, exercises, and small projects to apply my learnings in real scenarios.
